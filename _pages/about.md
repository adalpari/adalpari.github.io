My name here is _AdalPari_, a computer engineer who loves __Mobile World__ and development.

Since I was a kid I've been always interested in technical areas: computers, electronics, robotics, [mecano](http://www.meccano.com/)..

By the time, I started to focus on computers, 0's and 1's. And finally I did a __Degree__ and a __Master__ in __Computer Science__.

Nowadays I work as __Senior Android Developer__ and I love it â™¥.
