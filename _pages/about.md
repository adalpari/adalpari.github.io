My name is _Adalberto Plaza_, a computer engineer who loves solution design, development and __mobile world__.

Since I was a kid I've always been interested in computers, electronics and robotics. I enjoyed a lot building my own creations with [mecano](http://www.meccano.com/) and [k'nex](https://www.knex.com/). Or building my own line follower robot with recycled components!

By the time, I started focusing on computers, _0s_ and _1s_. And finally I studied a __Degree__ and a __Master__ in __Computer Science__ at [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=en).

Since the very beginning of my professional career I started working with Android and I discovered an amazing world. Learning not only about the basics, but going beyond: architectures and patterns, clean code and good practises, testing and so on. Crucial skills to become a good engineer and be able to provide a quality, maintainable and scalable code.

Nowadays I work as __Senior Android Developer and Product Manager__ at [Degoo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.degoo.android) and I love it ♥.
