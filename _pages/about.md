My name is _Adalberto Plaza_, a computer engineer who loves solution design, development and __mobile world__.

Since I was a kid I've been always interested in technical areas: computers, electronics, robotics, [mecano](http://www.meccano.com/) and so on.

By the time, I started focusing on computers, _0s_ and _1s_. And finally I did a __Degree__ and a __Master__ in __Computer Science__ at [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=en).

Nowadays I work as __Android Product Tech Manager__ at [Degoo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.degoo.android) and I love it ♥.
