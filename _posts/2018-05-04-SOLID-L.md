SOLID is an acronym that groups five basic principles every object oriented programmer should know. This principes set the base to write and maitain a robust code base.

1. [Single responsibility principle.](../2018-04-30-SOLID-S.md)
2. [Open/closed principle.](../2018-05-03-SOLID-O.md)
3. [Liskov substitution principle](../2018-05-04-SOLID-L.md).
4. Interface segregation principle.
5. Dependency inversion principle

In this post, we are going to talk about the Liskov Substitution.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle.

This principle is a bit hard to understand at the beginning. But you will see once you get it, all make sense. The principle says: if we are using the class _A_ in our code, and we extend it in class _B_, we should be able to put _B_ instances in all places that we are using _A_ in our code without breaking anything. In few words: substitute _A_ by _B_ without break the result.

Why this principle is good for the code base?.
- It assures that the extended classes are not breaking their parents logic.

Let's see the typical example for this principle. Imagine we have the _Rectangle_ class and we want to add our _Square_ class as well. All know that a square is actually a rectangle with all edges equals. So, at first sight looks ok to extend _Square_ from _Rectangle_.


```java
public class Rectangle {
	private int width;
    private int height;
 
    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }
 
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }
 
    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	private int width;
    private int height;
 
 	@Override
    public void setWidth(int width) {
    	// Set both because this is a square
        super.setWidth(width);
        super.setHeight(width);
    }
 
 	@Override
    public void setHeight(int height) {
    	// Set both because this is a square
        super.setWidth(width);
        super.setHeight(width);
    }
}
```

Now imagine that we calculate the area of the rectangle at some place in our program.

```java
public void myMethod() {
	Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle;
	rectangle.setWidth(6);
    rectangle.setHeight(4);
	System.out.println(rectangle.getArea()); // output is 24. 6 * 4
}
```

This code is quite clear. But, are we fitting the Liskov Substitution Principle?. I'm afraid we are not.. We are modifying the parent behaviour within a child class. Shadowing the setters with a bad behaviour. 

If we substitute the _rectangle_ by a _square_, when width or height are set in a square we override both variables, so `setsHeight(4)` is overriding both and the result is different from its parent (_4 * 4 = 16_). That also means basically that the line `rectangle.setWidth(6);` is dead code.

This problem could be solved having separated objects and implementing an interface that will assure that every object should have an area calculation.

```java
public interface AreaCalculable {
	public int getArea();
}
```

```java
public class Rectangle implements DrawableShape {
	private int width;
    private int height;
 
    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }
 
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }
 
    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

```

```java
public class Square implements DrawableShape {
	private int edge;

	public void setEdge(int edge) {
		this.edge = edge;
	}

	public int getArea() {
		return edge * edge;
	}
}
```

On the other hand, if we need our objects to extend from the same class, a solution could be remove the setters allowing to specify our object variables ONLY in the creation (immutable objects).

```java
public class Rectangle {
	private int width;
    private int height;
 
 	public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
 		this.width = width;
 		this.height = height;
 	}
    
    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	private int edge;
 
 	public Square(int edge) {
 		super.(edge, edge)
 	}
}
```
