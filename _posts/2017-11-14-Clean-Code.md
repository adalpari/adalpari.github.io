title: Let's clean the code!
---

One of the multiple _must_ that EVERY developer should do, is read:__*Clean Code*__ book from _Robert C. Martin_.

In that book, you will find basic and advanced rules and tips, to create good quality code in terms of readability. Easier to understand and mantain than a messy ugly code. These tips not only will make you a better developer but algo will save you great amount of time.

In order to have a "cheat sheet" about _Clean Code_ rules, I'm going to sumarize and write some key points. 

If you are reading this without have readed the book, run to your closest library!

## Meaninful names
- Reveal intention or use with the name.
- Avoid use the encode type (_string, integer.._)
- Avoid _m__ prefix. Use the colour code of your _IDE_.
- Use one single word per concept. Don't use _remove_ and _delete_, _fetch_ and _retrieve_, and so on.
- Classes: should be named with a noun or phrase.
- Methods: should be named with verb. The arguments should be nouns. That way a method will be _verb(noun)_
