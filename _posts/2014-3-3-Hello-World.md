title: Let's clean the code!
---

One of the multiple _must_ that EVERY developer should do, is read: *Clean Code* book from _Robert C. Martin_.

In that book, you will find basic and advanced rules and tips, to create good quality code in terms of readability. Easier to understand and mantain than a messy ugly code. These tips not only will make you a better developer but algo will save you great amount of time.

In order to have a "cheat sheet" about _Clean Code_ rules, I'm going to sumarize and write some key points. 

If you are reading this without have readed the book, run to your closest library!
